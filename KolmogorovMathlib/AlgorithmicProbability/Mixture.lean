# Countable Mixtures of Conditional Semimeasures

A *universal* semimeasure is built as a weighted countable mixture of a family of
semimeasures, and what makes such a mixture "universal" is **domination**: each
component, scaled by its weight, sits below the mixture. This module isolates the
purely measure-theoretic backbone of that construction, before any computability,
logarithm, or coding-theorem equality enters the picture.

For a weight sequence `w : ℕ → ℝ≥0∞` and a family
`μ : ℕ → BitString → BitString → ℝ≥0∞`, the mixture is

```
mixture w μ x y = ∑_i w i · μ i x y.
```

We prove three facts, all in `ℝ≥0∞`:

* `tsum_mixture_eq` — the total output mass of the mixture factors as
  `∑_i w i · (∑_x μ i x y)` (an equality, just `tsum` rearrangement);
* `weight_mul_le_mixture` — **domination**: `w i · μ i x y ≤ mixture w μ x y`, the
  one-term lower bound that the coding/universality theory stands on;
* `mixture_isConditionalSemimeasure` — if `∑_i w i ≤ 1` and every `μ i` is a
  conditional semimeasure, then so is the mixture.

The family is kept *abstract* (`μ : ℕ → …`): building it from `KP` would be
circular, and the mixture's lower-semicomputability is a strictly later concern.
A closing corollary instantiates the family at a sequence of prefix-machine a
priori semimeasures, connecting the abstract result to the machine layer.

Everything stays an inequality (`≤ 1`); no normalization equality is claimed.
